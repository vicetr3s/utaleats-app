# UtalEats Mobile App

UtalEats is a mobile application for food delivery, designed as part of a larger client-server system based on
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). This app enables users to explore stores, add products to a cart, place orders, and
rate stores, all from their mobile devices.

The mobile app integrates seamlessly with the backend system, which manages user accounts, stores, orders, and ratings.
The backend repository is available [here](https://github.com/fraco-oxza/utalEats.git).

Developed as part of the Software Design 2024 course project at Universidad de Talca.
